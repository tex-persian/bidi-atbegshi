The bidi-atbegshi package
v0.1

Bidi-aware shipout macros

The package adds few commands to `atbegshi' package
for proper placement of <background material> in the left
and right corners of the output page, in both LTR and RTL
modes. 

The package only works with `xelatex' format and should be
loaded before `bidi' package.

For more information, please see the documentation.


Current version release date: 2014/09/11
